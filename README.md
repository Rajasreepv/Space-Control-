# Space Counter: BLoC Learning Day 1

## Overview
A simple Flutter application demonstrating the basics of the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern. This project serves as a practical introduction to state management in Flutter using the BLoC architecture.

## What I Learned
- Fundamentals of BLoC pattern
- Separating business logic from UI components
- Implementing events, states, and BLoC classes
- Handling user interactions with event dispatching
- Responding to state changes in the UI

## Technical Implementation
- Flutter with BLoC pattern
- Space-themed counter application
- Event-driven architecture
- Immutable state management

## Core Components
- **Events**: `LaunchRocket`, `LandRocket`, `ResetRockets`
- **States**: `CounterState` tracking rocket count
- **BLoC**: `CounterBloc` handling business logic
- **UI**: Reactive interface that rebuilds based on state changes

## How It Works
1. User taps buttons to send events to the BLoC
2. BLoC processes events and updates state
3. UI rebuilds automatically when state changes
4. Rocket emojis visually represent the current count

## Key Features
- Add rockets with the "Launch" button
- Remove rockets with the "Land" button
- Reset count with "Reset Mission" button
- Visual representation of count with rocket emojis

## Next Steps
- Implement more complex state management
- Add persistent storage
- Explore BLoC testing strategies
- Combine with other Flutter pattern


## Repository
This project is part of my Flutter learning journey, focusing on modern state management techniques.
